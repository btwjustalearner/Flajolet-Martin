# Flajolet-Martin

I implement the Flajolet-Martin algorithm (including the step of combinine estimations from groups of hash functions) to estimate the number of unique cities within a window in the data stream. The details of the Flajolet-Martin Algorithm can be found at the streaming lecture slide. You need to find proper hash functions and the proper number of hash functions in the Flajolet-Martin algorithm.
